# sigmacover
Know the coverage of the sigmac backend in relation to the rules

it is a beta

## Why
Be able to tell which rules are usable if I use which backend.
So if I drop elastalert know what I lose and what I gain in detection

But above all practice writing a python program 

## TODO without order

- [ ] clean code (in progress)
- [X] fix bug (before add new)
- [ ] fix temp file
- [X] auto configure backend options
- [ ] better ouput
- [ ] add progress bar
- [ ] use sqlite
